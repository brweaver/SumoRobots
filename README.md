Getting started with the Zumo: 

1) install the Arduino IDE
	https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2) Install the Pololu A-Star drivers for the IDE:
	https://github.com/pololu/a-star

To install the add-on, copy the "pololu" folder into the "hardware" subfolder of
the Arduino sketchbook location.  The Arduino sketchbook location is typically
in your Documents folder in a subfolder named "Arduino".  You can see the
sketchbook location in the Arduino IDE Preferences dialog, which is available
from the File menu.

3) Install the Zumo examples:
	https://github.com/pololu/zumo-32u4-arduino-library

If you are using version 1.6.2 or later of the Arduino software (IDE), you can use the Library Manager to install this library:

	• In the Arduino IDE, open the "Sketch" menu, select "Include Library", then "Manage Libraries...".
	• Search for "Zumo32U4".
	• Click the Zumo32U4 entry in the list.
	• Click "Install".
